// infinite loop 
let i=0;
while(i<6){
    console.log("Hello");
    i--;
}
// there will be hello  infinite  times
//  because the logic applied here is wrong 
// Whenever ther is a infinite loop the ecevution never stops you have stop it forcefully 
// the browsing never stops 
// while implementing logics , one should be carefull
